Bard's Tale 3
=============

- Calculations (ok)
  3 Disks: 524544 (assuming no hidden data)
  Character disk unknown content (seems to be nearly empty)
  should be enough for character storage
  
- prodos analyse (ok)
  + io access to all files
  + how are savegames and gamestates stored?

- loader with modified util64
  do the import of characters at another place

- simple loader of all files
  jumptable for loading of the different files

- disable disk switches
  + diskswitch request sets the current disk to properly load sectors
