Bard's Tale 3
=============

- make the utility sector read and write faster
  + create character disk
  + restore from character
  + backup to character

- reduce amount of flash erases by using all 16 4k areas

- reset save game option (ok)

- character editor (ok)

- character import (ok)
  + loader with modified util64
  => seems to be a lot of work, not worth the time
  + maybe with a simple wrapper (loading/saving destination)
  + skip main menu and go straight to transfer characters
  + on exit, skip the main menu and go back to startmenu
  + extend the loading ans saving of the storage to both sectors
  + wrap the loading and saving of the destination sectors

- ask for not saving on party death (ok)
  + not necessary

- Calculations (ok)
  + boot disk: programs only, these do not take more than 65535 bytes, will allow two erasable flash areas
  + 3 data disks, these disks hold data as a prodos disk, meaning 280 sectors per 512 bytes => 143360
    => meaning: 9 erasable flash areas (147456 bytes)
  + save area: 3 areas (each need 2 erasable flash areas)
    + save game: 0x010b - 0x010d
    + refugee camp: 0x0110 - 0x0117
    + storage: 0x010e - 0x010f
  => some space for other files
  
- prodos analyse (ok)
  + io access to all files

- disable disk switches (ok)
  + diskswitch request sets the current disk to properly load or save sectors

- disable code wheel (ok)
  + ignore the code wheel
  + try to completely disable it
  + place modified sector on different place and load disk 1, sector 0x57 from that place
  + at start codewheel simple jump to: jmp A89C (change code at 0x0af51 in character disk)
  + 4c 9c a8

- savegame backup and restore (ok)
  + store track 18 of character disk as file on easyflash
  + use bd3 fast loader to create character disk?
  + maybe find another fast loader

- simple loader of all files (ok)
  + simple table with id for loading of the different files

- savegame management (ok)
  which sectors wil be changed?
  savegame: 010b, 010c, 010d (1536 bytes)
  camp: 0110, 0111, 0112, 0113, 0114, 0115, 0116, 0117 (4096 bytes)
  storage: 010e, 010f

- saving gamestats and characters (ok)
  character disk
  savegame: sectors: 0x10b, 0x10c, 0x10d (3 sectors: 1536 bytes)
  roster: sectors: 0x110 to 0x117 (8 sectors: 4096 bytes)
  storage: 010e, 010f (2 sectors: 1024 bytes)



File loading from easyflash
===========================

- small code to load up to 16 or 32 files from easyflash
- do not use efs filesystem, not necessary, simple system sufficient
- identify files by number, have a directory for 16 files, takes up one or two pages (256 bytes)
- directory entry
  0: id (1); value of ff means no file present, $00 means file invalid
  1: relative/absolute bank number (1)
  2: bank offset low/high (2)
  4: size (low/high/upper) (3)
  7: load address (low/high) (2)
  9: init call offset (low/high) (2) ; when value is zero do not call, call may not return, calling is optional
  11: reserved (5)
